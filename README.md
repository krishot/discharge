Health2.0 Hackathon Entry October 6th & 7th

This is the backend to a iPhone app that gives a simple to use list of health management tasks.  We got all the basics done and had an operational app for the Hackathon.  I decided to continue working this code and open the repo.  

There is no security nor a user authentication model added to this app yet.  It is totally open for now.
you can check out a working version at the url below.  I will pull this down if I get a spam attack.
